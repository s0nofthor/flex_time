# landing_page
This is my first attempt at making my very own landing page. While I could just use assets from around the web to show this, I did spend a little extra time learning how to add personal touches like creating my own logo. I hope this shows my proficiency with flex and my excitement towards finding little ways to add personal touches to everything that I do.
